This library provides supporting constants and functions for generating deterministic UUIDs (version 5) for UCO Hash and Facet nodes.

There are two general patterns implemented:

1. Some objects are "wholly specified" by their properties.  The leading example of this is uco-types:Hash, which has only the properties hashMethod and hashValue, and both are required to be provided in order to be conformant with UCO.  The function `hash_method_value_uuid` implements a scheme to generate UUIDs for uco-types:Hash nodes based on this pattern.
2. A pattern based on inherence generates UUIDv5s based on how an inherent object (a.k.a. UcoInherentCharacterizationThing) structurally relates to the object in which it inheres.  For instance, a Facet is understood to only relate to its UcoObject by linking with the uco-core:hasFacet property.  So, a Facet's UUID is determined uniquely by (1) the "UUID namespace" of its corresponding UcoObject, and (2) its OWL Class.
   A. The term "UUID namespace" is described in RFC 4122 Section 4.3 [#rfc4122s43]_ , and is not intended be confused with `rdflib.term.Namespace`.  For any uco-core:UcoThing (or even owl:Thing), the function `inherence_uuid` defines the procedure for either extracting or generating a UUID for use as a namespace.

This module is independent of, and complements, `case_utils.local_uuid`, which provides deterministic UUIDs based on calling process's environment.

A knowledge base ontology currently uses a prefix 'kb:', expanding to 'http://example.org/kb/'.  This knowledge base has a node kb:File-ac6b44cf-dc6b-4f2c-a09d-c9beb0a345a9. What is the IRI of its FileFacet?

>>> from case_utils.namespace import NS_UCO_OBSERVABLE
>>> ns_kb = Namespace("http://example.org/kb/")
>>> n_file = ns_kb["File-ac6b44cf-dc6b-4f2c-a09d-c9beb0a345a9"]
>>> n_file_facet = get_facet_uriref(n_file, NS_UCO_OBSERVABLE.FileFacet, namespace=ns_kb)
>>> n_file_facet
rdflib.term.URIRef('http://example.org/kb/FileFacet-01d292e3-0f38-5974-868d-006ef07f5186')

A documentation policy change has been enacted, and now all knowledge base individuals need to use the URN example form.  What is the FileFacet IRI now?

>>> ns_kb_2 = Namespace("urn:example:kb:")
>>> file_iri_2: str = "urn:example:kb:File-ac6b44cf-dc6b-4f2c-a09d-c9beb0a345a9"
>>> n_file_2 = URIRef(file_iri_2)
>>> n_file_facet_2 = get_facet_uriref(n_file_2, NS_UCO_OBSERVABLE.FileFacet, namespace=ns_kb_2)
>>> n_file_facet_2
rdflib.term.URIRef('urn:example:kb:FileFacet-01d292e3-0f38-5974-868d-006ef07f5186')

The two IRIs end with the same UUID.

>>> assert str(n_file_facet)[-36:] == str(n_file_facet_2)[-36:]
